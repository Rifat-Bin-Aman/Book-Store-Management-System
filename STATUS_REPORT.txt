KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

Note: These are by design for this demo application

- Test accounts use plain passwords in seed data
  (Auto-upgraded to bcrypt on first login)

- Book images are placeholder
  (All books use same book.png)

- No email notifications
  (System doesn't send emails)

- No payment processing
  (Demo-only checkout)

- Limited report generation
  (Basic activity logs only)

These are improvements that could be added in future versions.

     admin@bookhaven.test / admin1234
  3. Check DATABASE_VERIFICATION.txt for seed data info

Issue: Tables missing
Solution:
  C:\xampp\php\php.exe setup_db.php

Issue: AJAX functions not working
